Download sbt from OLEX

Untar into /usr/local/bin
tar -xzf PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_SBT_TARBALL /usr/local/bin

Set execution permissions on the binaries
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sbt/bin/*

Add sbt to your $PATH via ~/.bash_profile
Open for editing vi ~/.bash_profile
Add :/usr/local/bin/sbt/bin to $PATH

To configure sbt to use the State Farm Artifactory for dependencies, 
create a ~/.sbt/repositories file with the following inside
[repositories]
  local
  sf-artifactory: http://lt00as50.opr.statefarm.org/artifactory/repo

To authenticate to the State Farm Artifactory, create a ~/.ivy2/.credentials 
file with the following inside:
realm=Artifactory Realm
host=lt00as50.opr.statefarm.org
user=alias
password={DESede}…..
NOTE: No forward slashes in for the curly braces

Where USER is your alias and PASSWORD is your encrypted password from Artifactory, 
which can be found on your profile.

Note that each project will need to declare this credentials files in its 
build.sbt with the following:
credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".ivy2" / ".credentials")

Add a line to ~/.bash_profile to override default public repos

export SBT_OPTS="$SBT_OPTS -Dsbt.override.build.repos=true"
Reload your session (or create a new one)

source ~/.bash_profile

mkdir AND
cd ~/.ivy2/local/com.eed3si9n/sbt-assembly/scala_2.10/sbt_0.13/0.14.0/jars
cd ~/.ivy2/local/com.eed3si9n/sbt-assembly/scala_2.10/sbt_0.13/0.14.0/ivys
cd ~/.ivy2/local/com.eed3si9n/sbt-assembly/scala_2.10/sbt_0.13/0.14.0/srcs

copy files from https://dl.bintray.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt/0.13.9/

Create a file under ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/credentials.sbt that wires up the 
default credentials

credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / “.ivy2” / ".credentials")

Have build.sbt in the same directory as your project clone.

Have assembly.sbt under a project folder under the clone directory with the 
following contents
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.0")

Run SBT from first dataPrep directory. 
You should see the jar file under the target directory.
